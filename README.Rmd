![Style Guide Header](http://i.imgur.com/mZvS8Qn.png)

Adapted from Hadley Whickam’s ‘[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)’ and [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1429907/workflow-for-statistical-analysis-and-report-writing/) Stack Overflow question

As more Grattan staff make the noble switch from STATA to R, our work is more rigorously scrutinised, and we do more QC-ing of other’s R code it is worth adapting a single style.

As Hadley says, “Good style is important because while your code only has one author, it’ll usually have multiple readers. This is especially true when you’re writing code with others. In that case, it’s a good idea to agree on a common style up-front. Since no style is strictly better than another, working with others may mean that you’ll need to sacrifice some preferred aspects of your style.”

The formatR package, by Yihui Xie, makes it easier to clean up poorly formatted code. It can't do everything, but it can quickly get your code from terrible to pretty good. Make sure to read [the notes on the wiki](https://github.com/yihui/formatR/wiki) before using it.


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

# Packages

## Errors, warnings, and messages
Practise highly defensive programming. 
Almost all functions should check their inputs for validity, and provide errors or warnings.
Messages should be used sparingly, and only when the inputs are only likely to be used in an interactive session.

### Errors vs warnings
Errors should be raised in a function when its inputs:

  * cannot be interpreted meaningfully
  * would cause an obscure error when eventually used
  * have been used before and caused the wrong result

Warnings should be raised when the inputs have a *likely* interpretation, but there is a risk that that interpretation is not what was intended.

### Grammar and format of error and warning messages
An error message should:

  * **Use existing base R phraseology** where the error condition is practically identical:

    > `` Error: argument `fy.year` was missing, with no default ``

  * **Specify what input caused the error condition to occur.** In most cases, the first word should be the argument (enclosed in backticks) that is problematic. This part of the error message should be in the past tense, as if the function has come back from an attempt and realized that the inputs won't work. 
  
    > `` Line 1 was not \documentclass[<options>]{grattan} ``
  
    Even if what caused the problem is still present when the error message is emitted, it should not be in the present tense. The user's instructions have already been given; they're in the past. Further, using present tense could be confusing if the error message represents a condition that has since changed:
    
    ```{r}
    # Bad:
    
    if (x > 0.5) {
      stop("`x` is greater than 0.5.")  # What if x = runif(1) ?
    }
    
    ```

    When a default value conflicts with other values, use the conjunction `yet`:
   
    ```{r}
    
    project_to(sample_file_1112, "2014-15")
    #> `fy.year.of.sample.file` was not provided, yet its value could not be inferred from `sample_file`. nrow(sample_file) = 254273. Either use a 2% sample file of the years 2012-13, 2013-14, or 2014-15 or supply `fy.year.of.sample.file` manually.
    ```
    
  * **Contextualize** the error message by providing the substance of the error condition. (Optional)
  
  * **Advise what the user needs to change** in the next sentence. Except when the error message is canonical (*e.g.* `missing, with no default`), it should contain clear instructions on what to do, with an imperative mood.
  
    > `` File 'dsfihods' was not found; getwd()=='C:/Users/hughp/Documents/R-style-guide'. ``
    > `` Include correct full path, or one or more spaces to consider the input a system command. ``


  * If a plausible and satisfactory solution can be suggested, **offer a solution in the form of a question** as a separate sentence enclosed in parentheses. 
  
    > `` File 'dat/Australia.csv' was not found. Include correct full path. (Did you mean 'data/Australia.csv'?) ``
    
Warning messages:

  * **Specify the guess the function made that it is unsure about**.
  This should be written in the present tense, as if the program is sending an update about its progress.
  Even though an error message is written in the past tense despite being closer in time to the occurrence of the error condition, warning messages cannot guarantee the time in which they are emitted so the guess needs to be concurrent with the warning condition.
  
  * If possible, **specify a probable or worst-case** outcome if this warning message were ignored.
  
  * **Advise what the user needs to change** in the next sentence, as in error messages. 
  
  * If a plausible and satisfactory solution can be suggested, **offer a solution in the form of a question** as a separate sentence enclosed in parentheses.
  

Messages emitted by `message`:

  * Specify the condition that caused the message to occur.
  
  * Written in a tense that is appropriate for the message, most likely present. 


# Purposeful or literate files

### Preamble

You should take some time considering the purpose of the code you are developing. Are you writing code to put into a report? Are you conducting exploratory data analysis? Are you developing code which might span multiple reports (or even multiple programs)?

Despite being the default, R scripts are easy to write poorly. Experience has shown R scripts end up doing multiple things meaning that to understand any of the outputs, reviewers have to plough through multiple lines. 

## R scripts
R scripts should produce a **single** output, the exception with the outputs are very closely related. If multiple outputs are required, multiple scripts should be produced. 

## Code supporting analysis
Should be woven through `knitr`, most likely with a LaTeX (Rnw) flavour. It is imperative that code supporting analysis is written in a single document, optionally with a package.


## Notation and naming

### File names

File names should be meaningful and end in `.R`.

    # Good
    fit-models.R
    utility-functions.R

    # Bad
    foo.r
    stuff.r

If files need to be run in sequence, prefix them with numbers:

    1-load.R
    2-clean.R
    3-do.R

### Object names

Variable and function names should be lowercase. Use an underscore (`_`) to separate words within a name. Generally, variable names should be nouns and function names should be verbs. Strive for names that are concise and meaningful (this is not easy!).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
day_one
day_1

# Bad
first_day_of_the_month
DayOne
dayone
djm1
```

Where possible, avoid using names of existing functions and variables. This will cause confusion for the readers of your code.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Bad
T <- FALSE
c <- 10
mean <- function(x) sum(x)
```

## Syntax

### Spacing

Place spaces around all infix operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, etc.). The same rule applies when using `=` in function calls. Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```

There's a small exception to this rule: `:`, `::` and `:::` don't need spaces around them.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
x <- 1:10
base::get

# Bad
x <- 1 : 10
base :: get
```

but there is not exception to the rule in `data.table`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
DT[, x := y * 2]

# Bad
DT[ ,x := y * 2]
```

Place a space before left parentheses, except in a function call.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
if (debug) do(x)
plot(x, y)

# Bad
if(debug)do(x)
plot (x, y)
```

Extra spacing (i.e., more than one space in a row) is ok if it improves alignment of equal signs or assignments (`<-`).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
list(
  total = a + b + c, 
  mean  = (a + b + c) / n
)
```

Do not place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets (unless there's a comma, in which case see above).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
if (debug) do(x)
diamonds[5, ]

# Bad
if ( debug ) do(x)  # No spaces around debug
x[1,]   # Needs a space after the comma
x[1 ,]  # Space goes after comma not before
```

### Curly braces

An opening curly brace should never go on its own line and should always be followed by a new line. A closing curly brace should always go on its own line, unless it's followed by `else`. 

An opening brace should be preceded by a space.

Always indent the code inside curly braces.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good

if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("Y is negative")
}

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} else {
  y ^ x
}

# Bad

if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} 
else {
  y ^ x
}
```

It's OK to leave very short statements on the same line:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (y < 0 && debug) message("Y is negative")
```

### Line length

Strive to limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font. If you find yourself running out of room, this is a good indication that you should encapsulate some of the work in a separate function. If you are sharing your code you should not use the automatic ‘line wrapper’.

This is not a hard rule, however. Don't mangle your code to fit this rule:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# OK:
wage.url <- "http://stat.data.abs.gov.au/restsdmx/sdmx.ashx/GetData/LABOUR_PRICE_INDEX/1.THRPEB.7.-.0.30.Q/all?startTime=1997-Q3"

# Bad:
wage.url <- paste0("http://stat.data.abs.gov.au/restsdmx/", 
                   "sdmx.ashx/GetData/LABOUR_PRICE_INDEX/", 
                   "1.THRPEB.7.-.0.30.Q/all?startTime=1997-Q3")
```

### Indentation

When indenting your code, use two spaces. Never use tabs or mix tabs and spaces.

The only exception is if a function's arguments runs over multiple lines. In that case, indent the second line to where the definition starts:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
long_function_name <- function(a = "a long argument", 
                               b = "another argument",
                               c = "another long argument") {
  # As usual code is indented by two spaces.
  paste0(a, b, c)
}
```

### Assignment

Use `<-`, not `=`, for assignment.

```{r}
# Good
x <- 5
# Bad
x = 5
```

## Organisation

### Commenting guidelines

Comment your code. Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space: `# `. Comments should explain the why, not the what.

Use commented lines of `-` and `=` to break up your file into easily readable chunks.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load data ---------------------------

# Plot data ---------------------------
```

# knitr

## Naming

### Avoiding duplication
Whenever an object is created in the global environment, its assignment must be in a single chunk. The chunk name must be the exact name of the object created:

*Wrong:`
```{tex, eval = FALSE}
<<useful-objects>>=
discount_rate <- 0.05
n <- 15
values <- rep(100, n)
NPV <- sum(values / (1 + discount_rate) ^ seq_along(values))
@
```
*Better:*
```
<<discount_rate>>=
discount_rate <- 0.05
@

<<n>>=
n <- 15
@

<<values>>=
values <- rep(100, n)
@

<<NPV>>=
NPV <- sum(values / (1 + discount_rate) ^ seq_along(values))
@
```
Prefer fuctions than static objects. For example, the above would be better as:

*Best:*
```{r, eval = FALSE}
<<NPV>>=
NPV <- function(discount_rate = 0.05, n = 15, values = rep(100, n)){
  sum(values / (1 + discount_rate) ^ seq_along(values))
}
@
```

### Chunks which print charts
If a chunk prints a chart, the chunk should be named `y_axis-vs-x_axis-by-other-aes--filters`

*OK:*
```{r, eval = FALSE}
<<price-vs-carat-by-table>>=
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = table)) +
  geom_point()
@
  
<<price-vs-carat-by-table--nonIdeal>>=
ggplot(diamonds[diamonds$cut != "Ideal", ], aes(carat, price, color = table)) +
  geom_point() 
@
```

To remove ambiguity, the name may be preceded by the principal layer (*i.e.* the chart type):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
<<scatterplot-price-vs-carat-by-table>>=
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = table)) +
  geom_point()
@
  
<<hexbin-price-vs-carat-by-table>>=
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = table)) +
  geom_hex()
@

```

## Chunks should be idempotent
Chunks should be idempotent. 
That is, the output of a chunk should not depend on whether it has previously run.
(A function $f$ is **idempotent** if $f(f(x)) = f(x)$.)
This ensures that once a knitr file has been sourced, each chunk can be run individually and return the expected results.

Although modifying an existing knitr document to fit this requirement is hard, it is almost always possible. 

*Good:*
```
<<chunk1>>=
x <- 1
@

<<chunk2>>=
print(x^2)
@
```

*Bad:*

```

<<chunk1>>=
x <- 2
@

<<chunk2>>=
x <- x^2  # not idempotent
print(x)
@

```

Typically, files that fail this requirement will fail due to assignment of an object occuring before or after it attains its true value.

Note that a consequence of this is that the reassignment pipe `%<>%` is not permitted!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval=FALSE)
```

## Miscellaneous

Any function of a data.frame should include be piped:

```{r}
library(taxstats)
sample_file_1314 %$%
  mean(Taxable_Income)
```

When the RHS of an assignment contains a pipe, the right hand side must commence from a new line (indented naturally).

**Right**

```{r}
average_income_by_Sex <- 
  sample_file_1314 %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  summarise(average_income = mean(Taxable_Income))
```

**Wrong**

```{r}
average_income_by_Sex <- sample_file_1314 %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  summarise(average_income = mean(Taxable_Income))
```

When the RHS of a pipe is a closure, the object `dot` should represent the LHS, unless the word `dot` would be misunderstood:

```{r}
average_income_by_Sex <- 
  sample_file_1314 %T>%
  {
    dot <- .
    stopifnot(length(dot$Sex) == 2)
  } %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  summarise(average_income = mean(Taxable_Income))
```
